# Tic-Tac-Toe | Have Fun

Use [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://imarijoyborda.com/tic-tac-toe/) to play tic-tac-toe with a friend (local). 

Motivation: I implemented this game to practice OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
